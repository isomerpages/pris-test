**SINGAPORE, 11 October 2019** – The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) honoured 395 individual volunteers and Social Service Agencies (SSAs) for their dedication towards the rehabilitation of offenders and ex-offenders, at the SPS Volunteers Awards Ceremony 2019. Held at The Star Gallery, the event was graced by Mr Amrin Amin, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Health.

2.  This year’s ceremony, themed “Kaleidoscope of Heroes”, highlighted the diversity of the work of SPS volunteers, who provide a wide range of rehabilitation and reintegration support. These include religious, academic and social counselling to offenders, ex-offenders and their families. Such community support is integral to Prisons’ throughcare strategy, and plays a key part in an ex-offender’s rehabilitation and reintegration journey back into the community.

3. The annual SPS Volunteer Awards Ceremony recognises long-serving SPS volunteers whose dedication and contributions have made a real difference in the lives of offenders, ex-offenders and their families. Over 2,000 volunteers from 45 organisations have extended their helping hands to support offenders and ex-offenders in their rehabilitation journey, from the in-care to the aftercare phase of their incarceration. These volunteers also include around 300 Befrienders who foster meaningful pro-social relationships with the offenders, starting from their imprisonment to after their release.

4.  “The rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders and ex-offenders require strong partnerships with the community, and we are thankful that many volunteers have come forward to give their time and energy to support their journey back into society. Many ex-offenders have also been inspired by the efforts of our volunteers and return as volunteers themselves. This is testament to the strong impact of our volunteer network,” said Assistant Superintendent of Prisons 2, Muhammad Ali Bin Mochtar, Staff Officer from the Community and Family Policy Branch, Rehabilitation and Reintegration Division at SPS.
