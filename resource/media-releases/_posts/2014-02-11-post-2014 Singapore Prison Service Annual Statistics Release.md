**Enhancing Throughcare To Prevent Re-offending**

Senior Assistant Commissioner (SAC) Terrence Goh, Director of SPS' Rehabilitation and Reintegration Division, said, â€œWhile inmates must take responsibility and be committed to their rehabilitation, the support received from the community is integral to the success of their reintegration. In this regard, we need to raise the competency levels of case-workers, counsellors and volunteers in the aftercare sector. Trained volunteers are critical resources who work hand-in-hand with our counsellors and case-workers to address issues faced by the inmates and their families."
