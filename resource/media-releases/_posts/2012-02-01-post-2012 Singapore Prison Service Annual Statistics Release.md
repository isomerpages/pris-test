Singapore’s recidivism rate has gone down from 27.3% for the 2008 release cohort to 26.7% for the 2009 release cohort. Singapore’s current recidivism rate is considered low especially in comparison with other nations.

“Recidivism rates are influenced by many factors which will invariably lead to marginal fluctuations from year to year,” said Mr. Terrence Goh, Director, Rehabilitation and Reintegration Division, Singapore Prison Service. “It is more important to understand and consider these factors and take proactive steps to equip and help offenders break the offending cycle. While Prisons continues to maintain its commitment to ensuring the safe and secure custody of all inmates, it is also evolving its in-care efforts to better meet the rehabilitation needs of inmates. The aftercare component, which truly requires community-wide support, is equally crucial in providing offenders with the best chance of successful reintegration upon their release.”
