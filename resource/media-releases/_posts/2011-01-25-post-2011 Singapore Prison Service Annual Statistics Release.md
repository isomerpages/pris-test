**SINGAPORE PRISON SERVICE NEWS RELEASE: POSITIVE RECIDIVISM RATE A RESULT OF CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN PRISONS AND ITS KEY PARTNERS**

Singapore’s recidivism rate has decreased remarkably from 44.4 per cent for the 1998 release cohort to the current 27.3 per cent for the 2008 release cohort. Compared to other nations, Singapore’s current recidivism rate is considered low.

“Through the numerous rehabilitation and counselling programmes, we have helped many inmates, who are amenable to change, turn over a new leaf and equipped them with basic life-skills and knowledge to help them in their reintegration to society,” said Mr Desmond Chin, Deputy Director of Singapore Prison Service (SPS). “But these successes would not have been possible if not for the unwavering support we have received from our partners such as aftercare agencies SACA, SANA & ISCOS, our Prison volunteers and the community at large. They have played a critical role in helping us keep Singapore’s recidivism rate low.”

SPS leverages on a rigorous and strict inmate management regime, and an effective and targeted rehabilitation framework, to create an environment where deserving inmates are provided with the opportunity and inspired with the motivation to change and to break the offending cycle. Various rehabilitation programmes addressing stress, drug addiction, anger management, violence, family and reintegration have been introduced. Similarly, the Kaki Bukit Centre (Prison School) functions as an educational institute to enhance academic training and to improve inmates’ educational qualifications.
