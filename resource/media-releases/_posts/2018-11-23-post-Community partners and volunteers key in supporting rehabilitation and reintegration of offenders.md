**SINGAPORE, 23 November 2018** – The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) today recognised 405 individual volunteers and Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) for supporting the rehabilitation of inmates and ex-offenders, at the SPS Volunteers Awards Ceremony 2018. The event was graced by Guest-of-Honour, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Health Amrin Amin.

Volunteers play a crucial role in supporting SPS initiatives and rehabilitation programmes. Besides supporting in various secular and religious programmes, some volunteers are also befrienders who support offenders in their reintegration back into the community. These befrienders provide positive social support for their beneficiary inmates for a period prior to and after their release, acting as mentors who regularly keep in contact with them via visits in prison, as well as letters. VWOs are important community partners who collaborate with SPS to provide a strong support network working towards the reintegration of offenders.

 “While inmates themselves have to show resolve and be committed to positive change in order to lead a life without reoffending, the strong support from volunteers and community partners helps inspire hope in the inmates they reach out to,” said Valerie Chiang, Superintendent of Prisons and Senior Assistant Director of the Community & Family Policy Branch, Rehabilitation & Reintegration Division at SPS. “We appreciate the invaluable contributions of our volunteers, many of whom are long-serving, and are heartened to see their continued commitment to supporting the rehabilitation of inmates and ex-offenders.”

 The awards highlight the dedication of 1,900 volunteers whose unwavering support have made significant contributions in the lives of inmates, ex-offenders and their families, and is a testament to the community’s continuous support.
