Dear family members, we appreciate your understanding and co-operation in observing our precautionary measures during the Circuit Breaker (CB) and Phase 1 & 2 of Post-CB period. In line with the government’s phased approach to resume activities, we are pleased to inform you that Face-to-Face visits will resume with effect from 1 August 2020 onwards. Phone calls will cease after 31 July 2020. Please visit https://go.gov.sg/sps-visit-updates for visit details and other related information. 

A **maximum of three visitors** will be permitted for each visit. To help us manage the crowd for your safety, visitors will only be allowed into the Prison Link Centre (PLC) **45 minutes before** the scheduled visit time. We urge you to plan your travel and not to arrive too early to shorten your waiting time. Visitors will also be required to wear their face masks at the PLC and throughout the visit session at all times. We seek your understanding and co-operation to adhere to the safe management measures.  

We are monitoring the COVID-19 situation in the prison and community closely and should there be any further developments, we will keep family members informed of any changes promptly.
