Singapore Prison Service (SPS) will be facilitating phone calls in place of face-to-face visits and tele-visits. Phone call bookings will open from Saturday, 2 May 2020. Please login to your IPRIS account at www.ipris.sps.gov.sg if you wish to make a booking. Alternatively, you can call our visit booking hotlines at 6546 7169 / 70 / 71 / 72 during operating hours. We seek your understanding and patience if you are unable to login to IPris or get through to our call centre due to anticipated high traffic volume during the initial period.
