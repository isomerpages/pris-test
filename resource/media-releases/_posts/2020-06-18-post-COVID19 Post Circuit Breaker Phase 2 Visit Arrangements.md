Dear family members, we appreciate your understanding and co-operation in observing our precautionary measures during the Circuit Breaker (CB) and Phase 1 of Post-CB period. In line with the governmentâ€™s phased approach to resume activities, we are pleased to inform you that tele-visits will resume with effect from 1 July 2020 onwards. You can book one 30-min tele-visit and one 15-min phone call for the month of July.

A **maximum of three visitors** will be permitted for each tele-visit. To help us manage the crowd for your safety, visitors will only be allowed into the Prison Link Centre (PLC) **30 minutes before** the scheduled tele-visit time. We urge you to plan your travel and not to arrive too early to shorten your waiting time. Visitors will also be required to don their face masks at the PLC and throughout the tele-visit session. We seek your understanding and co-operation to adhere to the safe management measures.  

We will be monitoring closely the COVID-19 situation in the prison and community for the month of July and when it is assessed safe to resume face-to-face visits, we will be sure to keep family members informed.

Our booking calendar for tele-visits and phone calls for the month of July 2020 will be opened from 19 June 2020 2pm. Please visit our online portal at www.ipris.sps.gov.sg to make your booking. Alternatively, you can call our visit booking hotlines at 65467169/70/71/72 during operating hours.  Please visit https://go.gov.sg/sps-visit-updates for visit details and other related information.
