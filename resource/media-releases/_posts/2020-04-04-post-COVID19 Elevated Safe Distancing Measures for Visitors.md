In light of the stepped-up measures announced on Friday, 3 Apr 2020 to pre-empt escalating COVID-19 infections, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) will be implementing stricter safe distancing measures to ensure the safety and well-being of our inmates.

**All visits will be temporarily suspended from Tues, 7 Apr 2020 to Mon, 4 May 2020**. Thereafter, resumption of visits will be subject to further review.

Meanwhile, SPS is exploring alternative means of communication for our inmates and their loved ones. Details will be provided in due course via our online portal: www.ipris.sps.gov.sg.

To assist affected visitors, we will be keeping our visit hotline open on Saturday, 4 April & Sunday, 5 April, from 8.45am to 4.00pm. You may contact us at (+65) 6546 7169 /70 / 71 / 72.

**Family Resource Centres**

Operations at the Family Resource Centres (FRCs) located at Prison Link Centre (Changi) will be suspended from Tuesday, 7 Apr 2020 to Monday, 4 May 2020.

MSFâ€™s Social Service Offices (SSOs) remain open during this period. Families requiring social and financial assistance are encouraged to contact their nearby SSOs.
