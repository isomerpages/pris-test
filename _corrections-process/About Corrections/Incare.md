Upon admission to prison, offenders undergo assessment to determine their risks and needs. Based on their identified risks and needs, appropriate programmes are charted for intervention. The programmes include psychology-based correctional programmes, family programmes and religious services.

<u>**Learning Prison**</u><br>
As part of the Corrections 2025 Masterplan, SPS implemented Learning Prison (LP) which seeks to transform offenders into better persons during their incarceration, by inculcating learning and change. For effective rehabilitation to take place, offenders must take ownership and responsibility to learn prosocial coping strategies and turn their lives around. 

One of the ways that SPS achieves this is through My Action Plan (MAP), a personal planning tool that charts the rehabilitation of each offender. The offender’s Personal Supervisor guides him/her in this process with discussions on concerns, goals and designing an action plan towards the goals. The Personal Supervisor also discusses the offender’s learning and reflections after he/she attends programmes to reinforce the learning and action plan.  

SPS also partners Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) to offer offenders opportunities to attend Skills Training courses. These courses serve to improve offenders’ employability and increase their chances of securing a job after their release, by enabling them to develop foundational skills and attain competencies to help them perform jobs at higher levels.

At the pre-release phase, offenders are provided the relevant support to secure jobs and maintain their employment upon their release. Through skills deepening and career progression, offenders will be better prepared for their reintegration into the community.
