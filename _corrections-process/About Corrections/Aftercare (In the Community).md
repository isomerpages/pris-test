In the aftercare phase, SPS continues to build on the knowledge and skills that offenders have gained in prisons, via a structured and gradual reintegration process in the community. Offenders may be emplaced on [Community-Based Programmes (CBP)](/corrections-process/community-transition/cbp), where they reside at home or at approved residential facilities such as halfway houses. Mandatory supervision, counselling, and casework sessions are also extended to individuals who require additional support in the aftercare phase.

Eligible offenders will be assessed for CBP towards the tail-end of the sentence. SPS makes a holistic assessment of the offenderâ€™s suitability for CBP, taking into consideration his/her latest rehabilitation progress, general conduct, and reintegration plans. Please be assured that SPS considers all eligible offenders for CBP emplacement. If your loved ones are assessed suitable for CBP, the next-of-kin or person appointed will be informed in due course.
