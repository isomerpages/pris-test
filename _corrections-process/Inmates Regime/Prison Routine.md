All inmates typically have at least an hour of recreational time per day on weekdays. They can use this recreational time for physical exercise and ball games in the recreational yard or other activities such as watching television programs and playing board games. 

An example of a daily prison routine is as follows:

|Schedule| Activity | 
| -------- | -------- | 
|Morning | Breakfast<br>Recreational Activities|
|Noon-Afternoon |Lunch<br>Rehabilitation/labour programmes |
|Evening-Night|Dinner <br> Rest|
