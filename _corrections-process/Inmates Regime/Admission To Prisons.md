All inmates will undergo an admission process when they are sent to prisons. Upon admission, all personal belongings will first be taken and documented for safekeeping. 

Inmates will then be subjected to a thorough search for injuries, contraband, and any other items. 

Next, they will be informed of their length of sentence and date of release (details of inmate’s sentences meted out by the Courts will be verified to ensure there are no discrepancies), after which they will be medically screened and examined by a Prison Medical Officer (PMO). An admission briefing and interview will also be conducted.
