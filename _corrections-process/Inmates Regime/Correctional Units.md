Inmates are housed in Correctional Units (CUs) in institutions, subject to assessment of security and rehabilitation needs.  The CUs are similar in terms of set up with prison cells, a recreational yard, dining halls, televisit cubicles and multi-purpose rooms for the conduct of rehabilitation programmes.

Each CU is run by a team of CU officers who not only work to ensure a safe environment for inmates but aim to influence positive change in each inmateâ€™s behaviour and attitudes. The CU officers motivate inmates to take greater ownership of their rehabilitation right from the onset of incarceration, guiding inmates in setting their personal development goals, and reviewing their rehabilitation progress. 

Inmates can approach their CU officers if they require any assistance.
