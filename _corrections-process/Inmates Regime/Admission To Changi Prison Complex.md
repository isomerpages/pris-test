Details of inmates’ sentences meted out by the Courts will be verified to ensure there are no discrepancies in, for instance, the length of sentence and date of release. Inmates will also be similarly informed of these details.

For inmates, whom the Courts have ordered to pay compensation, fine or penalty, the next of kin (NOK) or family members can contact and seek assistance from the State Courts on how to go about making the payments on inmates’ behalf. Upon payment, NOK or family members can contact SPS via either email (PRIS_SentMgmt_Enquiry@pris.gov.sg)  or phone call (**6546 6739**), and if possible, also provide a scanned copy or photo of Payment Receipt for our necessary follow-up.

For inmates who admit to prison with properties, they can authorise their next of kin or family members to collect their properties from SPS-appointed property vendor on their behalf by submitting an online request via SPS website (https://www.sps.gov.sg/connect-us/other-visit-matters). For registered visitors, the request can be submitted to the Visit Officer at Prison Link Centre (Changi) at their next visit while non-registered visitors are required to contact Visit Booking Hotline to make an appointment for the collection. 

All newly admitted inmates will be medically screened and examined by a prison doctor and appropriate medical care and management will be provided. 

Inmates will be housed in institutions subjected to assessment of security and rehabilitation needs.
