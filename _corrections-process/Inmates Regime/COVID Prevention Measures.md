Given the high density and close-living environment in our prisons, SPS has implemented various precautionary measures (in addition to prevailing Safe Management Measures) since Jan 2020 to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmissions among inmates, staff and personnel working in our prisons:

1. All newly admitted inmates will undergo cohort segregation and are tested for COVID-19 infection. They will be allowed to join the general inmate population after clearing the cohort segregation period.
2.  All inmates are issued with reusable masks. Inmates are required to wear their masks when out of their cells.
3.  COVID-19 vaccination is made available to all medically eligible inmates.
4.  All inmates who are unwell are referred for medical attention.
5.  Any inmate who is tests positive for COVID-19 will be isolated from the general inmate population. They will be provided the necessary medical care for recovery.
6.  All close contacts will also be isolated and tested.
7.  Staff will don the necessary Personal Protective Equipment when handling any COVID-19 related cases.
