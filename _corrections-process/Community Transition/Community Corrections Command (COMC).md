The Community Corrections Command (COMC) was formed in August 2014 as an operational unit overseeing the rehabilitation, reintegration and supervision of offenders and ex-offenders in the community. COMC is made up of uniformed officers and civilian specialists who work with offenders and community partners in aftercare.

#### Reintegration Officers

Reintegration Officers are uniformed staff that supervise offenders in the community, by ensuring compliance to supervision conditions. They also work closely with the community partners and provide case management to the offenders and ex-offenders under their charge. Offenders will be assigned to Reintegration Officers when they are serving CBP or undergoing MAS in the community.

#### Correctional Rehabilitation Specialists
