#### Conditional Remission System
Conditional Remission System (CRS) seeks to deter ex-offenders from re-offending by subjecting them to conditions upon their release. Under the CRS, all inmates will be issued with a Conditional Remission Order (CRO) which will be valid until the end of their sentence and this is known as the “remission period”. 

Most ex-offenders will generally still be released after they have served two-thirds of their sentence, if they had displayed good conduct and behaviour in prison. When they are released, they will be issued with a CRO with the basic condition of not to re-offend during this remission period and must also not be convicted and sentenced to any of the following:

* A sentence of imprisonment (excluding a default sentence)
* Reformative Training
* Corrective Training
* Preventive Detention

This will be in addition to any sentence that may be imposed for committing an offence in breach of the basic condition, and there shall be no one-third remission for the enhanced sentence. The maximum length of the enhanced sentence shall not exceed the remaining duration of the Conditional Remission Order from the date of the “new” offence. 

The implementation of the CRS will high-risk ex-inmates to be placed on a Mandatory Aftercare Scheme.

#### Mandatory Aftercare Scheme

The Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS) is a compulsory structured aftercare regime that provides enhanced community support, counselling and case management with tight supervision for a selected group of ex-offenders at risk of re-offending and also those who need more support in reintegration into society. It aims to support ex-offenders in staying crime-free and deter them from re-offending.

The scheme will consist of supervision and restrictions such as curfew hours and electronic monitoring, as well as counselling and case management. Upon release at the two-thirds mark of their sentence, ex-offenders who are required to undergo MAS will be placed progressively through these step-down aftercare support and supervision.

The Selarang Halfway House was established by SPS in 2019 as the first Government-run facility to provide structured aftercare support for selected high risk ex-offenders. It is a secular residential, step-down facility set up to offer a residential programme as part of the MAS.
