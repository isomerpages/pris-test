Yellow Ribbon Singapore or YRSG, is a statutory board under the Ministry of Home Affairs. SPS partners closely with YRSG to provide skills training and employment assistance for offenders and ex-offenders, and to engage the community through the Yellow Ribbon Project.

**Career Coaches**<br>
Career coaches conduct assessments, job profiling and matching of offenders with suitable jobs. They also provide career coaching to help offenders understand their employment pathways and address potential work challenges. Suitable CBP supervisees may be assigned to career coaches to assist them in their employment matters.

**Other Community Partners**<br>
Other stakeholders who also play an important role to support community corrections include:
* Government agencies such as Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)
* Law enforcement agencies such as Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB)
* Community Action for Rehabilitation of Ex-Offenders (CARE) Network partners
* Volunteers from various organisations such as Social Service Agencies (SSA)

**Supporting families through incarceration; Supporting your loved ones’ rehabilitation**<br>
SPS recognizes that incarceration of a loved one can be a difficult period for you and your family. In the Letter of Notification, you will also find a list of relevant helping resources in the community that can help you and your families. You may also approach the Family Resource Centre located at Prison Link Centre (Changi) to speak to a social worker.

SPS collaborates with many partners in the community to support families and offenders. During the rehabilitation journey, your loved one is able to request assistance for the family from partners like grassroots volunteers under the Yellow Ribbon Community Project, Family Service Centres and other social service agencies. You will also be invited to participate in programmes that aim to enhance your relations with your family members, including your incarcerated loved one. Some programmes also offer support to the children under your care. 
SPS encourages your participation as your involvement in your loved one’s rehabilitation will help to motivate them and strengthen their resolve to desist from a life of crime and return as responsible members of your families.
