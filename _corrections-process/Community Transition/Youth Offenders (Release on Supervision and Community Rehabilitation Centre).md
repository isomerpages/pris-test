**Release on Supervision (ROS)**<br>
Release on Supervision (ROS) remains a mandatory component of Reformative Training to ensure that the RT inmate’s rehabilitation needs are addressed and is well reintegrated before he/she is considered for discharge from RT. A RT inmate will be reviewed regularly by the RTC Review Committee (RTCRC) to determine his/her suitability for release on supervision, depending on his/her rehabilitation needs identified, conduct and progress in RTC.

During ROS, Reintegration Officers and Case Workers will be assigned to the RT inmate to provide the intervention and guidance in their reintegration to the community. When the RT inmate fails to comply with any of the requirements stipulated in the supervision order, he/she is subjected to disciplinary actions leading to a recall back to RTC. Actions will be taken in accordance to the severity of the breach, from verbal warning to reflective thinking process to a recall.

Recalled RT inmates whose supervision order has been revoked will be reviewed regularly on their suitability for ROS. Recalled RT inmates will also be required to attend a Recallee Programme to address key reintegration challenges and prepare them better for the next ROS.

**Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC)**<br>
The Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC) was officially launched in January 2015, to help first time young drug offenders to rehabilitate into society with minimal disruptions after they have completed a short detention at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC). This is part of SPS’s mission to offer tailored rehabilitation programmes to better address the needs of these abusers based on their risk profiles.

The CRC regime can be defined in two phases – Residential and Home Leave.

*Residential Phase <br>
For the first six months of their stay, this phase offers casework and counselling services to help residents build resilience against drug addiction and strengthen their family ties. They can attend school or work outside the CRC during this period. 

*Home Leave Phase <br>
In the last six months, residents will be assessed on their suitability to return to their families and will be electronically tagged. In addition to supervision and support by their family members, they will continue to receive counselling by their assigned caseworker to ensure that they stay on track and drug-free. 

At the end of the programme, the offenders will be placed on the Central Narcotics Bureau’s (CNB) Supervision Order for a period of up to five years to ensure that they remain drug-free in the long run. 

**Selection and Admission Process ** <br>
SPS works closely with CNB to assess a drug abuser’s suitability for the CRC regime based on the following criteria: 

* Candidates must be first-time drug abusers, aged 16 to 21 years old and assessed to be of moderate risk of re-offending; and 
* Candidates’ families have committed to visiting and supporting the candidates during their residency at CRC, as well as providing close supervision of the candidates when they transit to the home leave phase. 

Upon successful placement at CRC, residents are to abide by the Centre’s rules and regulations, and breaches may result in a transfer back to the DRC. 

**Partnering the Community ** <br>
SPS partners the Youth Guidance Outreach Services (YGOS), a youth-focused Social Service Agency (SSA), to be the managing agent of CRC. YGOS taps on its network of community resources to target drug abuse, offering various programmes.

**Community Partners engaged by YGOS ** <br> 
Apart from YGOS, SPS engages other community partners, which include the Community Development Councils (CDCs), Family Service Centres (FSCs), religious organisations and other SSAs, to support the residents in their journey towards their rehabilitation goals.
