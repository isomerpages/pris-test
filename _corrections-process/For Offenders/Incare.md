##### Work Programmes
SPS partners Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) to provide opportunities for inmates to undergo work programmes. Across SPS, inmates engage in work programmes in various areas such as the prison kitchens, bakery, laundry facility, logistics workshops, multimedia workshops and call centres. The key objective of the work programmes is to instil good work ethics and discipline in the inmates as most of them may not have held stable jobs before their incarceration. Inmates who are engaged in work programmes are also given an allowance, which they can use to purchase items which include personal grooming items and snacks.

Inmates can also remit part of their work allowance to their families, under the Inmates’ Caring Act through Remittance of Earning (iCARE) scheme. The Inmates’ Families Support Fund (IFSF) provides a dollar-to-dollar matching to the families, capped at $400 per year. This scheme provides the opportunity for inmates to continue contributing to their families financially despite their incarceration, while instilling in them a sense of responsibility towards their families.

##### Vocational Skills Training
SPS’ partnership with YRSG also offers inmates opportunities to attend Skills Training courses. These courses, accredited with the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ), improve the inmates’ employability and increase their chances of securing a job after their release. Each year, about 5,300 inmates undergo Skills Training courses. These training courses cover areas in Precision Engineering, Media [Specialist Diploma in Social Media Marketing and Online Content Creation and WSQ Diploma in Media (Content Management)] and Logistics. In the pipeline are more training courses in food services. Inmates are able to develop their foundational skills and attain job-specific competencies needed to perform job tasks at higher levels.

##### Education
Education has been offered in prisons since the 1960s. SPS strongly advocates and recognises that education in prisons is one of the vital elements to reintegrate inmates into society. Today, Prison School runs academic classes at various levels, including General Education pegged at Secondary 1 Normal Academic (NA), GCE NA, Normal Technical (NT), Ordinary (O) and Advanced (A) levels. Each year, about 450 inmates undertake education studies in the Prison School. In 2018, in collaboration with Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Prison School started offering the Diploma in Business Practice (International Supply Chain Management) course to students.

Since July 2020, a self-study and self-funding degree programme has been offered as a progression opportunity for those who have completed their Diploma course in prisons. In partnership with the Singapore University of Social Sciences, the Bachelor of Science in Logistics & Supply Chain Management programme is conducted. Despite being a self-study programme, the students get to meet their lecturers once a week for lessons.

Yellow Ribbon Fund collaborates with Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Association (SFCCA) to fund GCE ‘A’ level or Diploma students of any race who wish to continue their studies and take up the Bachelor of Science programme in Logistics and Supply Chain Management.

##### Release Preparation Programmes
SPS prepares inmates to be released for re-integration into the society. The programme aims to equip inmates with useful self-motivation, problem-solving and coping skills to handle the challenges and immediate issues faced upon their release.

##### Personal Development Activities
SPS keeps inmates meaningfully engaged by providing Personal Development Activities that would complement the regime that they are going through. These activities aim to cultivate or further inmates’ interests in areas such as performing arts and arts and craft.

##### Programmes for intervention 


| Team | About | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| General Violence    | HERO (Honour, Empathy, Resilience, Ownership) is an open-group psychology-based correctional programme developed for offenders who have committed violent offences.<br><br>The open group format in HERO is modular based consisting of four core modules and two electives. New participants enter the group at the start of each module and those who have completed all required modules can graduate from the programme. Participants who have demonstrated necessary qualities and indicated their willingness to contribute to the HERO community, remain in the programme as Peer Facilitators.<br><br>HERO is for offenders assessed to be at a higher risk and needs of violent reoffending. Some of the main objectives of the programme are to increase participants’ understanding on how their thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and behaviours are interrelated, and to help participants develop helpful thoughts and beliefs, adaptive emotional regulation skills, prosocial conflict resolution, and effective communication skills. It also aims to help participants develop a non-violent identity that is aligned to their prosocial values and goals, and to assist them with the development of effective and feasible risk management strategies. Those with more entrenched violent beliefs or present with risk of violence toward their family members will also attend elective modules to address these additional needs. |
|Sexual Violence|ExCEL+ is for sexual offenders assessed to be at a higher risk and needs of sexual reoffending. It was developed in consultation with Dr. Liam Marshall, both a practitioner and researcher who is a leading Subject-Matter-Expert in sexual offender intervention. Some of the intervention targets for the ExCEL+ programme include addressing issues related to self-esteem, shame and guilt, increasing insight into unhealthy sexual behaviours, developing healthy emotional and sexual self-regulation skills, addressing cognitive distortions that support sexual offending, and improving interpersonal and relational skills. At the end of the programme, offenders are also guided to develop individualised risk management strategies to mitigate their risks of sexual re-offending and achieve pro-social goals as part of their reintegration. |
