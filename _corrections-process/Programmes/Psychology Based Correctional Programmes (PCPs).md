SPS provides a range of psychology-based correctional programmes (PCPs) for offenders under our care. These PCPs aim to enhance the motivation of offenders to change and address their unhelpful thinking patterns related to offending. Prosocial skills training is also provided in the programmes to help offenders achieve lives that are free from drugs and crime.
 
In general, the development of PCPs is guided by (1) the needs assessment of the local offender populations, (2) established rehabilitation frameworks, and (3) best practices that are proven effective in reducing recidivism in the corrections literature. Specifically, the theoretical orientation of the PCPs is influenced by three known rehabilitation models and theory â€“ namely the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) model, the Good Lives Model (GLM) and the Desistance Approach.
 
The PCPs also utilize evidence-based intervention strategies such as the Cognitive-Behavioural model and the Social Learning theory to address the criminogenic needs of the offenders. Offenders learn to manage their emotions and behaviours through restructuring their unhelpful cognitions into more constructive ones in a systematic manner, and practice constructive skills such as communication, emotion regulation, and problem-solving skills to help them manage high-risk situations and prevent relapse. For specific populations such as the women and youths, relevant intervention strategies are incorporated in the PCPs to meet their unique needs and responsivity.
