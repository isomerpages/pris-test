SPS engages agencies specialising in family services to deliver structured family programmes in prison. These programmes help to increase inmates’ knowledge, skills, and confidence in maintaining ties and building stronger relationships with their family members. In turn, this facilitates their reintegration back to a supportive family network upon their release and helps to minimise their risk of re-offending.
 
Other family’s programmes include the family bonding programme where inmates and their family members interact and bond over family-friendly activities (e.g., during Mothers’ Day or Fathers’ Day celebrations). Some of the partner agencies include The Salvation Army (TSA), Singapore Children’s Society, New Life Stories (NLS) and Centre for Fathering (CFF).
