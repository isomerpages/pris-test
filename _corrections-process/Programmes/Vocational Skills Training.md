SPS’ partnership with YRSG also offers inmates opportunities to attend Skills Training courses. These courses, accredited with the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ), improve the inmates’ employability and increase their chances of securing a job after their release. Each year, about 5,300 inmates undergo Skills Training courses. These training courses cover areas in Precision Engineering, Media [Specialist Diploma in Social Media Marketing and Online Content Creation and WSQ Diploma in Media (Content Management)] and Logistics. In the pipeline are more training courses in food services. Inmates are able to develop their foundational skills and attain job-specific competencies needed to perform job tasks at higher levels.
