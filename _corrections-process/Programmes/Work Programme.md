##### Work Programmes
SPS partners Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) to provide opportunities for inmates to undergo work programmes. Across SPS, inmates engage in work programmes in various areas such as the prison kitchens, bakery, laundry facility, logistics workshops, multimedia workshops and call centres. The key objective of the work programmes is to instil good work ethics and discipline in the inmates as most of them may not have held stable jobs before their incarceration. Inmates who are engaged in work programmes are also given an allowance, which they can use to purchase items which include personal grooming items and snacks.

Inmates can also remit part of their work allowance to their families, under the Inmates’ Caring Act through Remittance of Earning (iCARE) scheme. The Inmates’ Families Support Fund (IFSF) provides a dollar-to-dollar matching to the families, capped at $400 per year. This scheme provides the opportunity for inmates to continue contributing to their families financially despite their incarceration, while instilling in them a sense of responsibility towards their families.

##### Vocational Skills Training
SPS’ partnership with YRSG also offers inmates opportunities to attend Skills Training courses. These courses, accredited with the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ), improve the inmates’ employability and increase their chances of securing a job after their release. Each year, about 5,300 inmates undergo Skills Training courses. These training courses cover areas in Precision Engineering, Media [Specialist Diploma in Social Media Marketing and Online Content Creation and WSQ Diploma in Media (Content Management)] and Logistics. In the pipeline are more training courses in food services. Inmates are able to develop their foundational skills and attain job-specific competencies needed to perform job tasks at higher levels.
