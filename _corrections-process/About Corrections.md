#### Rehabilitation Process

The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is a key partner in the criminal justice system. As a correctional agency, our mandate lies in enforcing safe and secure custody and facilitating rehabilitation for offenders. Through rehabilitation, offenders undergo positive transformation and return to society as contributing citizens, helping to keep Singapore a safe and secure home. 

SPS adopts a throughcare approach in the rehabilitation of offenders. This change process begins in prison and continues when the offender returns to society. Programmes and interventions, informed by evidence and the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) Model, are designed to address the offenders’ criminogenic thinking and behaviour, improve prosocial skills, enhance employability and other protective factors.

The rehabilitation journey for the offender can be divided into two key phases – Incare (in prison) and Aftercare (in the community).
