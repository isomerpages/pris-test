### Rehabilitation Process
The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is a key partner in the criminal justice system. As a correctional agency, our mandate lies in enforcing safe and secure custody and facilitating rehabilitation for offenders. Through rehabilitation, offenders undergo positive transformation and return to society as contributing citizens, helping to keep Singapore a safe and secure home.

SPS adopts a throughcare approach in the rehabilitation of offenders. This change process begins in prison and continues when the offender returns to society. Programmes and interventions, informed by evidence and the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) Model, are designed to address the offenders’ criminogenic thinking and behaviour, improve prosocial skills, enhance employability and other protective factors.


The rehabilitation journey for the offender can be divided into two key phases – [Incare (in prison)](https://pris-test-staging.netlify.app/rehabilitation-process/for-inmates/incare) and[ Aftercare (in the community)](https://pris-test-staging.netlify.app/rehabilitation-process/for-offenders/aftercare).

#### Incare
Upon admission to prison, offenders undergo assessment to determine their risks and needs. Based
on their identified risks and needs, appropriate programmes are charted for intervention. The programmes include psychology-based correctional programmes, family programmes and religious services.

**Learning Prison** <br>
As part of the Corrections 2025 Masterplan, SPS implemented Learning Prison (LP) which seeks to transform offenders into better persons during their incarceration, by inculcating learning and change. For effective rehabilitation to take place, offenders must take ownership and responsibility to learn prosocial coping strategies and turn their lives around.

One of the ways that SPS achieves this is through My Action Plan (MAP), a personal planning tool that charts the rehabilitation of each offender. The offender’s Personal Supervisor guides him/her in this process with discussions on concerns, goals and designing an action plan towards the goals.
The Personal Supervisor also discusses the offender’s learning and reflections after he/she attends programmes to reinforce the learning and action plan.

SPS also partners Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) to offer offenders opportunities to attend [Skills Training courses](https://pris-test-staging.netlify.app/rehabilitation-process/for-inmates/incare). These courses serve to improve offenders’ employability and increase their chances of securing a job after their release, by enabling them to develop foundational skills and attain competencies to help them perform jobs at higher levels.

At the pre-release phase, offenders are provided the relevant support to secure jobs and maintain their employment upon their release. Through skills deepening and career progression, offenders will be better prepared for their reintegration into the community. If you require more information on available resources for your loved ones after release, please refer to the[Community Resources Brochure](/files/SPS%20-%20Community%20Resources%20Brochure.pdf).


#### Aftercare
In the aftercare phase, SPS continues to build on the knowledge and skills that offenders have gained in prisons, via a structured and gradual reintegration process in the community. Offenders may be emplaced on [Community-Based Programmes (CBP)](https://pris-test-staging.netlify.app/rehabilitation-process/for-offenders/halfway-care), where they reside at home or at approved residential facilities such as halfway houses. Mandatory supervision, counselling, and casework sessions are also extended to individuals who require additional support in the aftercare phase.

Eligible offenders will be assessed for CBP towards the tail-end of the sentence. SPS makes a holistic assessment of the offender’s suitability for CBP, taking into consideration his/her latest rehabilitation progress, general conduct, and reintegration plans. Please be assured that SPS considers all eligible offenders for CBP emplacement. If your loved ones are assessed suitable for CBP, the next-of-kin or person appointed will be informed in due course.
