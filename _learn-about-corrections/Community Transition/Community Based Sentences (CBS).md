Community Based Sentences (CBS) is an alternative sentencing option by the Courts which does not result in a criminal record upon successful completion of the sentence. It is for suitable low-risk first time offenders, taking into consideration the circumstances of the case, and nature of the offence.

Cases that are suitable for CBS are generally sent to the Community Court for management. The Community Court adopts a problem-solving approach that combines criminal justice and community resources for a comprehensive response.
