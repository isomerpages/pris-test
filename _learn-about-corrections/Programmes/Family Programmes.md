The Singapore Prison Service engages agencies specialising in family services to deliver structured family programmes in prisons. These programmes help to increase inmates’ knowledge, skills, and confidence in maintaining ties and building stronger relationships with their family members. In turn, this facilitates their reintegration back to a supportive family network upon their release and helps minimise their risk of re-offending.
 
Other family programmes include family bonding programme where inmates and their family members interact and bond over activities. 

Some of the partner agencies include The Salvation Army, Singapore Children’s Society, New Life Stories and Centre for Fathering. (link to their websites)
