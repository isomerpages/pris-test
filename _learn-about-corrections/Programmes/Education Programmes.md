Education programes have been offered in prisons since the 1960s. The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) strongly advocates and recognises that education in prisons is one of the vital elements to reintegrate inmates into society.

Today, the Prison School runs academic classes at various levels, including General Education pegged at Secondary 1 Normal Academic (NA), GCE NA, Normal Technical (NT), Ordinary (O) and Advanced (A) levels. Each year, about 450 inmates undertake education studies in the Prison School. 

In 2018, in collaboration with Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Prison School started offering the Diploma in Business Practice (International Supply Chain Management) (RRD to recommend page to link) course to students.
 
Since July 2020, a self-study and self-funding degree programme has been offered as a progression opportunity for those who have completed their Diploma course in prisons. In partnership with the Singapore University of Social Sciences, the Bachelor of Science in Logistics & Supply Chain Management programme is conducted. Despite being a self-study programme, the students get to meet their lecturers weekly for lessons.

[Yellow Ribbon Fund](https://www.yellowribbon.gov.sg/yellow-ribbon-fund) collaborates with Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Association (SFCCA) to fund GCE ‘A’ level or Diploma students of any race who wish to continue their studies and take up the Bachelor of Science programme in Logistics and Supply Chain Management.
