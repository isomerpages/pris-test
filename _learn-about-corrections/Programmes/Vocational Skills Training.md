The Singapore Prison Service partners [Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG)](https://www.yellowribbon.gov.sg/) to uplift inmates through skills and career development for their eventual reintegration to society. 

YRSG provides skills training and career opportunities through various initiatives in their Skills and Career Masterplans. These Skillsfuture Singapore (SSG)-approved trainings are curated in consultation with other public agencies, partnering employers, trade associations and chambers of commerce for relevance. 

The domains span of skills offered range from Critical Core Skils, such as digital fluency, self-management, sense-making, to Technical Skills and Competencies in sectors such as Precision Engineering, Logistics, Food Services and Media. 

YRSG’s TAP (Train and Place) & Grow initiative enables a throughcare training approach where inmates acquire basic to intermediate training during incarceration, start employment after release, and upskill in the community while employed.
