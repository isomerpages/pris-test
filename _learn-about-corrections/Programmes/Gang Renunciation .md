The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has in place gang management strategies with supporting programmes to encourage inmates with gang affiliations to desist from gang involvement and sever their gang ties. Some of the programmes implemented include the Gang Renunciation Programme and the Tattoo Removal Programme.

Under the Gang Renunciation Programme, inmates who make the resolve to sever ties with their gangs will be supported to embark on a gang renunciation journey. This includes supporting them to make a public renunciation of their gang membership during a Gang Renunciation Ceremony that is attended by their family members. 

The programme enables them to rebuild family relationships and develop a pro-social lifestyle through relevant rehabilitation programmes while in prison and after their release.

Volunteer doctors also provide tattoo removal services to inmates who have undergone the Gang Renunciation Programme during their incarceration. The removal of gang tattoos helps to reduce the inmatesâ€™ stigma associated with their gang affiliations.
