The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has in place gang management strategies with supporting programmes to encourage inmates with gang affiliations to desist from gang involvement and sever their gang ties. Some of the programmes implemented include the Gang Renunciation Programme and the Tattoo Removal Programme.

Under the Gang Renunciation Programme, inmates who make the resolve to sever ties with their gangs would be supported to embark on a gang renunciation journey – this include supporting them to make a public renunciation of their gang membership at a Gang Renunciation Ceremony  attended by their family members, other inmates, staff and prison volunteers; enabling them to rebuild family relationship and prosocial lifestyle through relevant rehabilitation programmes while in prison and after their release, and providing them free access to tattoo removal treatment to eradicate their gang identity symbolised by their tattoos. 

Volunteer doctors provide free tattoo removal service to inmates who have undergone the **Gang Renunciation Programme** during their incarceration. The removal of the gang tattoo helps reduce the inmates’ stigma associated with their gang affiliations and tattoos, and enables them to have better employment and re-integration prospects when they are released from prison.
