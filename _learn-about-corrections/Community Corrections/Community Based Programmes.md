Community-Based Programme (CBP) promotes the reintegration of amenable inmates into society with the help of their family members and the community, by emplacing them within the community towards the tail-end of their sentence. It provides an opportunity for the inmates to gradually reintegrate in the community by building up their capacities to reconnect with their families and be gainfully employed as contributing members of the society.

<strong><u>Is my loved one suitable for CBP?</u></strong><br>
**Penal inmates:** All penal inmates will be screened and assessed for their eligibility and suitability. Eligible inmates will only be assessed for CBP after they have served half their sentence in prison. Some inmates are legally excluded from CBP consideration due to the type of offence committed. Eligible inmates assessed to be suitable for CBP may be emplaced for a maximum period of 12 months prior to their release.

**Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) inmates:** For inmates detained at the DRC, CBP is part of their Drug Rehabilitation Regime. Hence, they will be emplaced on a suitable CBP scheme upon completion of their in-care rehabilitation regime, subject to their progress and conduct during their rehabilitation programme. 

*There is no need to apply for CBP as those who qualify for it will automatically be considered.*

**What are the various types of CBP available?**

##### What to Do
**Pre-emplacement**<br>
Once inmates are recommended for CBP, they will undergo Release Preparation Programmes prior to their emplacement. Reintegration Officers from Community Corrections Command (COMC) will also conduct pre-emplacement briefing and interviews to the inmates on the conditions and expectations of CBP.

**For Families** <br>
For HDS/RS scheme, the main visit cardholder will receive an SMS providing the inmate’s tentative date of emplacement and an undertaking form to seek his/her support for inmate’s emplacement to HDS/RS. A notification letter will also be sent to the family members informing on the date of emplacement. Family members are advised to read up on the family briefing form via the QR code and link provided in the emplacement letter.

For emplacement to DRS/WRS/HWH scheme, a notification letter providing details on the scheme and the relevant contact information will be sent to the Next-of-Kin prior to emplacement.

**Day of Emplacement**<br>

Inmates will be transferred to [Selarang Park Community Supervision Centre (SPCSC)](http://www.onemap.gov.sg/main/v2/?lat=1.3708718379447&lng=103.978312286363) on the day of emplacement. They will undergo a briefing on the supervision conditions by their assigned RO. Arrangement for electronic tagging will also be done on emplacement day.

If you wish to send in clothing, you may make an appointment by calling the visit booking hotline at 6546 7169/70/71/72. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation, family members are advised not to receive the inmate from SPCSC.

**Reintegration Officers** <br>
Reintegration Officers are uniformed SPS staff that support supervisees in the community, by ensuring their compliance to supervision conditions. They also work closely with community partners and provide case management to the supervisees and ex-offenders under their charge. 
![](/images/Recruitment/RO.jpg)
All CBP inmates will be assigned to Reintegration Officers during their programme. Inmates who are assessed to require more intervention may also be assigned to Correctional Rehabilitation Specialists, who will conduct mandatory counselling during their CBP.

**Correctional Rehabilitation Specialists**<br>
Correctional Rehabilitation Specialists who are civilian staff, provide case management services to supervisees in the community. Case management services include assessments, counselling, advocacy, mediation, and making referrals.
