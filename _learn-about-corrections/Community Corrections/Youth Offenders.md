Release on Supervision (ROS) remains a mandatory component of [Reformative Training](/corrections-process/prison-regime/reformative-training) to ensure that the RT inmate’s rehabilitation needs are addressed and is well reintegrated before he/she is considered for discharge from RT. A RT inmate will be reviewed regularly by the RTC Review Committee (RTCRC) to determine his/her suitability for release on supervision, depending on his/her rehabilitation needs identified, conduct and progress in RTC.

During ROS, Reintegration Officers and Case Workers will be assigned to the RT inmate to provide the intervention and guidance in their reintegration to the community. When the RT inmate fails to comply with any of the requirements stipulated in the supervision order, he/she is subjected to disciplinary actions leading to a recall back to RTC. Actions will be taken in accordance with the severity of the breach, from verbal warning to reflective thinking process to a recall.

Recalled RT inmates whose supervision order has been revoked will be reviewed regularly on their suitability for ROS. Recalled RT inmates will also be required to attend a Recallee Programme to address key reintegration challenges and prepare them better for the next ROS.

**Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC)**<br>
The Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC) was officially launched in January 2015, to help first time young drug offenders to rehabilitate into society with minimal disruptions after they have completed a short detention at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC). This is part of the Singapore Prison Service’s mission to offer tailored rehabilitation programmes based on their risk profiles to better address the needs of these drug offenders based on their risk profiles.

The CRC regime can be defined in two phases – Residential and Home Leave.

*Residential Phase* <br>
For the first six months of their stay, this phase offers casework and counselling services to help residents build resilience against drug addiction and strengthen their family ties. They can attend school or work outside the CRC during this period. 

*Home Leave Phase* <br>
In the last six months, residents will be assessed on their suitability to return to their families and will be electronically tagged. In addition to supervision and support by their family members, they will continue to receive counselling by their assigned caseworker to ensure that they stay on track and drug-free. 

**Partnering the Community**<br>
SPS partners the [Youth Guidance Outreach Services (YGOS)](https://www.ygos.sg/), a youth-focused Social Service Agency (SSA), as the managing agent of CRC. YGOS taps on its network of community resources to target drug abuse, offering various programmes such as career counselling, sports and mentoring programmes.
