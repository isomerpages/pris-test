Inmates are housed in Correctional Units (CUs) within prison institutions, based on assessment of security and their rehabilitation needs.  The CUs are similar in terms of set up with prison cells, a recreational yard, dining halls, televisit cubicles and multi-purpose rooms for rehabilitation programmes.

Each CU is managed by a team of Correctional Unit Officers (CUOs) enforce the security custody of inmates as well as aim to influence positive change in their behaviour and attitudes. The CUOs motivate inmates to take greater ownership of their rehabilitation from the onset of incarceration, guiding inmates in setting their personal development goals, and reviewing their [rehabilitation progress](/throughcare-approach). 

Inmates can approach their CUOs if they require any assistance.
