Given the high density and close living environment in prisons, Singapore Prison Service (SPS) implemented precautionary measures (in addition to prevailing Safe Management Measures) to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmissions among inmates, staff and personnel working in prisons.

These include:
*  All newly admitted inmates will undergo cohort segregation and are tested for COVID-19. They will be allowed to join the general inmate population after clearing the cohort segregation period.
*   All inmates are issued with reusable masks and are required to wear their masks when out of their cells.
*   COVID-19 vaccination is available to all medically eligible inmates.
*   Inmates who are unwell are referred for medical attention.
*   Inmates who test positive for COVID-19 will be isolated from the general inmate population. They will be provided the necessary medical care for recovery and their close contacts will also be isolated and tested. (Ops to reconfirm)
*   Staff will don the necessary Personal Protective Equipment when handling any COVID-19 related cases. (Ops to reconfirm)
