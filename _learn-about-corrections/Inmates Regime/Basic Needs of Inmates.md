**Safety, Conduct and Discipline**<br>

Prison Institutions are strict places. There are rules and regulations in place to ensure that safety, security and discipline are maintained. A safe prison environment allows inmates to focus on their [rehabilitation](/rehabilitation-process), while officers carry out their duties and volunteers feel assured while engaging inmates. It also gives families of inmates the assurance that their loved ones are safe in the prison. Family members should encourage their loved ones to follow the rules and regulations in prisons and participate in of the rehabilitation programmes available to them.

Inmates who disrupt the order in prisons by committing institutional offences will be subjected to a thorough investigation by Investigation Officers, which includes taking statements from the complainants, witnesses and the accused, as well as reviewing all evidence relevant to the case.  A Superintendent, who is not from the institution where the inmate is housed at, will preside over the case. The Superintendent will consider all facts of the case, before deciding if the inmate is guilty, and if so, the punishments to be imposed.

**Meals**<br>
Inmates are provided with three meals daily, which are planned based on a dietician’s recommendation to ensure they meet nutritional requirements. For breakfast, inmates have bread with a spread like butter, jam or chocolate, and a hot beverage, like coffee or tea. Lunch and dinner consist of a staple, like rice or noodles, with accompanying dishes and fruits. 

Special dietary requirements are considered. For example, inmates who are diabetic are given a sugar-free diet, while inmates who are vegetarian request for a vegetarian diet. 

**Basic Necessities**  <br>
Inmates will be issued with the following necessities:

SPS works with its medical service provider to attend to inmates’ medical needs. There are daily in-house clinics on weekdays, and the Prison Medical Officer (PMO) will attend to inmates who report sick. After office hours, on weekends and on public holidays, nurses and an on-call doctor are available.

Inmates may also alert any prison officer at any time if they are feeling unwell, and they will be referred to medical staff for examination. While awaiting the arrival of medical personnel, inmates may also receive first aid and other medical attention from prison officers who are trained to provide such assistance. Inmates can raise with prison officers, if they have any issue with the medical help they are seeking.

If assessed necessary by the PMO, inmates can be referred to public healthcare institutions for management of more complex medical issues.
