(Dayroom / Yard / Rehab / Work)

All inmates generally have an hour of recreational time per day on weekdays. They can use this recreational time for physical exercise and ball games in the recreational yard or other activities, such as watching television programs and playing board games.

Besides recreational time, inmates may also be scheduled for rehabilitation programmes, such as [Psychology Based Correctional Programmes](/corrections-process/programmes/psychology-programmes) (PCPs) and [work programmes](/corrections-process/programmes/work-programme). Additionally, inmates will also receive family visits and attend religious counselling sessions.

In the evening, inmates will have access to the Digitisation of Inmate Rehabilitation and Corrections Tool (DIRECT). The DIRECT consists of a suite of applications running on shared tablets issued to inmates to support their rehabilitation and self-directed learning. With DIRECT, inmates have access to resources such as e-letters, e-books and various rehabilitation programmes. The inmates can make use of the e-letter app to foster ties with their loved ones, while learning materials enable them to learn at their own pace and take greater ownership of their rehabilitation.	

An example of a daily prison routine is as follows:
