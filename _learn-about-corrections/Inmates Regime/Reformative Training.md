(To confirm if it will be here)

A Reformative Training (RT) sentence comprises a residential phase of up to 36 months and a statutory supervision phase up to 54 months from the date of sentence.  All reformative trainees admitted to Reformative Training Centre (RTC) will undergo the RT regime, with a minimum detention period of either 6 or 12 months as deemed appropriate by the court for their rehabilitation. All RTs are encouraged to maintain good conduct, take ownership of their rehabilitation and complete the required rehabilitation programmes. After serving the minimum period of detention and completing the required rehabilitation programmes, the RT will be reviewed by the RTC Review Committee to determine their suitability for release under a supervision order (community supervision phase).

**RT Regime** <br>
The Reformative Training (RT) regime was first established in 1957, modelled after the Borstal System in the United Kingdom with the following philosophy:

*“A Reformative Training Centre should emphasize the importance of developing a programme of activities which will help young offenders to review their past behaviour and encourage the development of more responsible lifestyles in preparation for their return to community.”*

Aligning to the SPS’s vision of inspiring everyone at every chance, the RT regime adopts a rehabilitative approach to reform young offenders into becoming contributing citizens. To better address the rehabilitation needs of the RT, a RT may undergo psychology-based correctional programme, family programmes and education programmes/employability skills training and personal development programmes, depending on the rehabilitation needs identified. 

**Community Supervision Phase - Release on Supervision (ROS)**<br>
During the community supervision phase also known as Release on Supervision (ROS), SPS staff will be assigned to the RT to provide intervention and guidance for their reintegration to the community. The RT will also undergo electronic tagging. Should the RT contravene with the requirement(s) of the supervision, the RT may be recalled back to RTC for key reintegration issues to be addressed before subsequently being emplaced on community supervision again.
