The Singapore Prison Service adopts a throughcare approach in the rehabilitation of offenders. This change process begins in prison and continues when the offender returns to society. Programmes and interventions, informed by evidence and the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) Model, are designed to address the offenders’ criminogenic thinking and behaviour, improve their pro-social skills, enhance their employability and other protective factors.

Through rehabilitation, offenders undergo positive transformation and return to society as contributing citizens, keeping Singapore a safe and secure home.

The rehabilitation journey for the offenders can be divided into two key phases – [Incare (in prison)](/corrections-process/about-corrections/incare) and [Aftercare (in the community)](/corrections-process/about-corrections/aftercare).
