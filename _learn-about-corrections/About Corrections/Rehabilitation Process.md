The Singapore Prison Service adopts a throughcare approach in the rehabilitation of offenders. This change process begins in prison and continues when the offender returns to society. Programmes and interventions, informed by evidence and the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) Model, are designed to address the offendersâ€™ criminogenic thinking and behaviour, improve their pro-social skills, enhance their employability and other protective factors.

Through rehabilitation, offenders undergo positive transformation and reintegrate to society as contributing citizens, keeping Singapore a safe and secure home.

The rehabilitation and reintegration journey for offenders can be divided into two key phases ;<br> - [Incare](/corrections-process/about-corrections/incare) (in prison) and <br> - [Aftercare](/corrections-process/about-corrections/aftercare) (in the community).
