During aftercare, Singapore Prison Service (SPS) continues to build on the knowledge and skills that inmates have gained in prisons, through a structured and gradual reintegration process in the community. Inmates may be emplaced as supervisees on [Community-Based Programmes](/corrections-process/community-transition/cbp) (CBP), where they reside at their homes or at approved residential facilities such as Halfway Houses. 

Mandatory supervision, counselling and casework sessions are also extended to supervisees who require additional support.

Eligible inmates will be assessed for CBP towards the tail-end of their sentences. SPS makes a holistic assessment of the inmate’s suitability for CBP, taking into consideration his/her latest rehabilitation progress, general conduct, and reintegration plans. If your loved ones are assessed suitable for CBP, the next-of-kin or person appointed will be informed in due course.
