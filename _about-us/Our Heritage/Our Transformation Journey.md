<h3>OUR JOURNEY TO TRANSFORMATIONS</h3>
Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has come a long way from being a custodial agency to a leading correctional agency which enforces the safe and secure custody of inmates, and rehabilitates them to prevent re-offending for a safer Singapore. Strong community partnerships and support for second chances for ex-offenders have helped to keep recidivism rates in Singapore low and stable. The two-year recidivism rate for the 2018 release cohort is 22.1 per cent, down from about 44 per cent two decades ago.<br>

      <strong>G. E. W. W. Bayly, First Commissioner of Prisons</strong><br />When the British Military Administration was replaced by a civil government, Singapore became a Crown Colony and the Prisons Department (now known as Singapore Prison Service) was instituted as a government agency. G. E. W. W. Bayly became the first Commissioner of Prisons after the Second World War. The photo shows the first logo of then Prisons Department. The insignia reflects Prisons Department as an agency in the Straits settlement under the purview of the Crown Colony.

The others were used for workshops as shown in the photo.
