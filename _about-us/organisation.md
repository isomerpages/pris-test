The Singapore Prison Service (SPS), a uniformed organisation institutionalised in 1946, is one of the 11 Agencies under the [Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).](www.mha.gov.sg)

Together, we form the Home Team (HT). SPS contributes to MHA’s Vision “A Trusted Home Team, A Safe and Secure Singapore” through the secure custody and rehabilitation of offenders. 
From a traditional custodial agency faced with challenges of overcrowded prisons and manpower shortage due to high staff turnover and poor public perception, SPS is now a leading correctional agency with a stellar safety and security track record, characterised by effective inmate management and sustained low recidivism rates. 

SPS staff, which are known as [Captains of Lives (COLs)](/about-us/captains-of-lives), are highly engaged and work in an organisation recognised as one of Singapore’s Best Employers. 
SPS’s tagline: “Rehab, Renew, Restart” emphasises our commitment to rehabilitate inmates who desire to change, renew and restart their lives for the better, with the support of the community.
