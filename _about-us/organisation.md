The Singapore Prison Service (SPS), a uniformed organisation institutionalised in 1946, is one of the 11 Agencies under the [Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).](www.mha.gov.sg)

Together, we form the Home Team (HT). SPS contributes to MHA’s Vision “A Trusted Home Team, A Safe and Secure Singapore” through the secure custody and rehabilitation of offenders. 
From a traditional custodial agency faced with challenges of overcrowded prisons and manpower shortage due to high staff turnover and poor public perception, SPS is now a leading correctional agency with a stellar safety and security track record, characterised by effective inmate management and sustained low recidivism rates. 

SPS staff, which are known as Captains of Lives (COLs), are highly engaged and work in an organisation recognised as one of Singapore’s Best Employers. 
SPS’s tagline: “Rehab, Renew, Restart” emphasises our commitment to rehabilitate inmates who desire to change, renew and restart their lives for the better, with the support of the community.
