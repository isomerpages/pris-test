Started in 2004, the Yellow Ribbon Project [Yellow Ribbon Project](https://www.yellowribbon.gov.sg/community-engagement/yellow-ribbon-project) is a community initiative in Singapore that aims to create awareness of the need to give second chances to ex-offenders, generate acceptance of ex-offenders and their families in the community, and inspire community action to support the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders into society. 

The Yellow Ribbon Project is an initiative under the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-Offenders (CARE) Network, which comprises:
* Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) 
* Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) 
* Singapore Prison Service (SPS)
* Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) 
* National Council of Social Service (NCSS)
* Industrial & Services Co-operative Society Ltd (ISCOS) 
* Yellow Ribbon Fund (YRF) 
* Singapore After-Care Association (SACA) 
* Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) 

Since the inception of Yellow Ribbon Project, events and activities, such as the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run, Yellow Ribbon Songwriting Competition, Yellow Ribbon Community Art & Poetry Exhibition (ADD LINK) and Yellow Ribbon Culinary Competition, have been organised with the support of community partners to showcase the skills and talents of inmates and <br>ex-offenders.
