**We make a real impact**

Our Captains of Lives keep Singapore safe by ensuring the secure custody of inmates in an impartial and humane manner.

In our pursuit to be an exemplary correctional agency, we maintain the highest standards of order and discipline. We also provide customized programmes to achieve the best **rehabilitation** outcomes.

We help inmates take ownership of their own rehabilitation, by positively influencing them to **renew** their family bonds and successfully reintegrate into society.

Our role also extends beyond the prison walls. We work closely with our community partners to support and guide ex-offenders as they take steps to **restart** their lives.

Our Captains of Lives are mentors, coaches, and role models to those under our charge.
