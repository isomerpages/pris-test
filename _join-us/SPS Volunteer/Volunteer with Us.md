### ROLE OF A PRISON VOLUNTEER
**Why do we want to engage volunteers in our Rehabilitation Efforts?**

Prisons recognises that the community including volunteers and non-government organisations have important roles to play in the rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-offenders. Volunteers bring with them their expertise in the various fields, and impart their knowledge to the offenders through the various programmes / activities. Being in the community, the volunteers can also help to link the released offenders back to the community, facilitating the reintegration process.

**Where does the Volunteer fit in this process?**

Prison volunteers come in to work with the offenders, in the areas of religious programmes and services, social programmes, academic and enrichment programmes. Volunteers are also one of the sources of pro-social support for the released offenders in the community.
