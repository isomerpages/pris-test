Prison volunteers come in to work with the offenders, in the areas of religious programmes and services, social programmes, academic and enrichment programmes. Volunteers are also one of the sources of pro-social support for the released offenders in the community.

**a. Role of a Volunteer in the offender’s rehabilitation journey**

 Volunteers play an integral role in the offender’s rehabilitation and desistance journey. When volunteers engage the offenders, ex-offenders and their families, you give hope and help rebuild lives.
 
As a volunteer, you:
* Share knowledge and impart skills to help the offenders increase their reintegration potential.
* Provide the emotional support that encourages offenders to stay focused and committed to their rehabilitation while serving sentence.
* Assist to stabilise and strengthen families left vulnerable when a loved one is incarcerated.
* Form part of the prosocial network in the community, to reinforce the ex-offenders’ resolve to desist and support the reunification of families after release.
 
The path to recovery and desistance can be challenging and is rarely straightforward. SPS welcomes you to join us on our journey towards a society without re-offending.


**b. Areas where you can contribute as a Volunteer**

The programmes and services facilitated by volunteers complement the rehabilitative initiatives provided by SPS to better prepare offenders for eventual return to the society. Hence, volunteering can be done in various forms, within and/or beyond the prison walls. You can volunteer to:

**(1) Be a SPS Befriender**<br>
Prosocial support is among the key factors that prevent reoffending. You can volunteer to be a SPS Befriender and be a friend to offenders who want to restart their lives among positive peers. As a Befriender, you will support offenders who may be at any phase of their incarceration through letter-writing, phonecalls and visitations. The befriending journey continues into the aftercare as your befriendee prepares to re-enter society with yours and the community’s support.
 
**(2) Be an Academic Tutor**<br>
Academic education is one of the rehabilitation programmes available to offenders. Together with full-time teachers from MOE and independent adjunct teachers, as a Volunteer Tutor, you support the offenders’ aspirations towards academic qualifications.
 
**(3) Be a Facilitator of religious, family, or other personal development programmes or services**<br>
 Volunteers facilitating religious programmes and services provide spiritual guidance and emotional support to offenders.
 When volunteers facilitate family programmes or services, you help offenders and their families gain useful knowledge and skills to become more effective members of the family, gain stability and strength to move forward as a family including in the aftercare. Children also benefit both directly and indirectly when families are supported by volunteers.
 Volunteers possess a wealth of experience and competencies. You can volunteer to impart skills (e.g., IT literacy) and share knowledge (financial planning) with the offenders and their families.
 
**(4) Be a Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) volunteer**<br>
YRCP is a grassroots-led initiative that provides community support and assistance to families impacted by incarceration through grassroots organisations. As a YRCP volunteer, you will engage and befriend these families and where necessary, link them up with helping agencies in the local community.
 
While the activity may differ, the higher purpose of volunteering is the same, to be the second chances of the offenders, ex-offenders, and their families.
