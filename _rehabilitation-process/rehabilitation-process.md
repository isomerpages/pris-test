The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is a key partner in the criminal justice system. As a correctional agency, our mandate lies in enforcing secure custody and rehabilitation for offenders. We believe that by rehabilitating our inmates, society can continue to be safe even when these offenders leave prison. In doing so, we contribute towards making Singapore a safe and secure home.

We adopt a throughcare approach in the rehabilitation of offenders where there are efforts to address the risks and needs of offenders inside prison and seamlessly followed through outside of prison. Our approach is based on the Risk-Needs-and-Responsivity Model which is generally accepted as the key evidence-based theory on rehabilitation.

The rehabilitation journey can be divided into two key phases – Incare (in prison) and Aftercare (in the community).

### **INCARE**
Upon admission to prison, offenders undergo assessment to determine their risks and needs. Based on their identified risks and needs, appropriate programmes are charted for intervention. The programmes include psychology-based correctional programmes, family programmes, skills training and religious services.

Prior to their release, offenders will also undergo programmes to prepare them for reintegration into the community upon their release.

### **AFTERCARE**
In the aftercare phase where the offender will face challenges in the community, aftercare interventions seek to provide him with adequate support upon his release.

Suitable and eligible offenders may also be emplaced on Community Based Programme where they may serve the tail-end of their sentence in the community under SPS’s supervision.
