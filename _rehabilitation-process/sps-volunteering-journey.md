**Registration and Process**

Depending on your area of interest, you may volunteer as an individual or under any of the Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs) that are currently partnering with SPS to provide a more structured programme. By registering through these organisations, your needs and aspirations as a volunteer could be better served by closer volunteer-inmate matching and mutual support among fellow volunteers.

All applications is subject to processing and upon successful, you will be scheduled to attend two sessions of Basic Prison Training (BPT) before you can be granted entry to commence your volunteering service in SPS. It is compulsory for you to undergo the BPT as it provides you with skills and knowledge on delivering a purposeful service to the inmates.

**Developmental Volunteer Training**

The Development Framework for Offender Rehabilitation Personnel (DORP), launched by the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) in January 2014 aims to enhance service delivery for our partners who undertake offender work, ensure professionalism and help to manage the complex needs of offenders and ex-offenders in their rehabilitation journey. The training opportunities provided will enhance the skills and competencies in their roles as Prison volunteers.

**Appreciation and Recognition**

In appreciation of our volunteers’ contribution in offenders’ rehabilitation efforts, an annual SPS Volunteers Awards Ceremony is organised at the end of each year. This event is held for the volunteers to thank them for their efforts, valuable time and commitment put in in their years of volunteering with SPS. Volunteers who have served 3, 5 and 10 years will be presented with a Long Service Award. Long serving volunteers who have made significant contributions during their service with SPS may also be nominated for the Minister of Home Affairs National Day Awards (HT Volunteers).
