#### **Community Based Programmes**
##### What is the Community Based Programme (CBP)?
CBP promotes the reintegration of eligible and suitable inmates into society with the help of their family members and the community, by emplacing them out into the community towards the tail-end of their incarceration. It provides an opportunity for the inmates to reconnect with their families and be gainfully employed as contributing members of the society. 

##### Is my loved one suitable for CBP?

**Penal inmates:** All penal inmates will be screened and assessed for their eligibility and suitability. There is no need to submit an application for CBP as those who qualify for it will automatically be considered. Eligible inmates will only be assessed for CBP after they have served half their sentence in prison. Some inmates are legally excluded from CBP consideration due to the type of offence committed. Eligible inmates assessed to be suitable for CBP may be emplaced for a maximum period of 12 months prior to their release. This allows the Institution Assessment Panel to make a holistic assessment on the inmate’s suitability for CBP, taking into consideration the inmate’s latest rehabilitation progress, general conduct, and reintegration plan.

**Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) inmates:** For inmates detained at the DRC, CBP is part of their Drug Rehabilitation Regime. Hence, they will be emplaced on a suitable CBP scheme upon completion of their in-care rehabilitation regime, subject to their progress and conduct during their rehabilitation programme. 

##### What are the various types of CBP available?

Prior to emplacement, inmates will undergo Release Preparation Programme to prepare them for reintegration into the community upon their release.

Prior to emplacement for HDS/RS, the Main Visit Cardholder will receive an SMS providing the inmate’s tentative date of emplacement and an Undertaking Form to seek his/her support for inmate’s emplacement to HDS/RS. 
<br>For emplacement to HWH/WRS/DRS, a notification letter providing details on the scheme and the appointed Reintegration Officer (RO) for the inmate will also be sent to the Next-of-Kin prior to emplacement.
