i.  Supporting families through incarceration; Supporting your loved ones’ rehabilitation

SPS recognizes that incarceration of a loved one can be a difficult period for you and your family. In the Letter of Notification, you will also find a list of relevant helping resources in the community that can help you and your families. You may also approach the Family Resource Centre located at Prison Link Centre (Changi) to speak to a Social Worker.

SPS collaborates with many partners in the community to support families and offenders. During the rehabilitation journey, your loved one is able to request assistance for the family from partners like grassroots volunteers under the Yellow Ribbon Community Project, Family Service Centres and other social service agencies. You will also be invited to participate in programmes that aim to enhance your relations with your family members, including your incarcerated loved one. Some programmes also offer support to the children under your care. SPS encourages your participation as your involvement in your loved one’s rehabilitation will help to motivate them and strengthen their resolve to desist from a life of crime and return as responsible members of your families.
