Visits by loved ones are important in the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates. Through bonding with their loved ones, inmates continue to keep in touch with their families and develop positive social support towards their motivation to change.

Family visits can positively impact offenders by:<br>
##### Helping Inmates cope with imprisonment<br>
Buffer inmates from depressive symptoms due to isolation and adjustment to prison life.

##### Reduce Inmates Misconduct
Consistent visits significantly reduce misconduct in general and major violent acts of misconduct.

##### Rebuild Support Networks<br>
Visit is an allocated time for inmates to reconcile and improve relationships with family. The quality of relationships between inmates and their families is an important consideration to rehabilitative outcomes.
