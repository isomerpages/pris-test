Visits play an important role in the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates. It is a means where the inmate's families, friends and loved ones, are engaged to enhance family bonding and develop positive social support towards the inmates' rehabilitation and eventual re-integration into the community. Family visits can positively impact offenders and SPS by:

**1. Helping offenders cope with imprisonment**<br>
Buffer offenders from depressive symptoms due to isolation and adjustment to prison life.

**2. Reduce Offender Misconduct**<br>
Consistent visits significantly reduce misconduct in general and major violent acts of misconduct.

**3. Rebuild Support Networks**<br>
Visit is an allocated time for offender to reconcile and improve relationships with family. The quality of relationships between offender and family is an important consideration to rehabilitative outcomes.
