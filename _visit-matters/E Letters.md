Good communication is important to maintain a healthy relationship. DIRECT allows inmates to connect with their families and friends through e-letters in addition to regular visits.

As inmates using DIRECT e-letters are able to view their incoming letters and greeting cards on their electronic tablets, they no longer receive their incoming letters and greeting cards in hardcopy format from January 2022. The hardcopy letters and greeting cards will be scanned and made available to inmates on their electronic tablets. 

Letters from legal counsel or other official government agencies will continue to be provided to all inmates in hardcopy format.

Inmates not using DIRECT e-letters shall continue to receive their incoming letters and greeting cards, and letters from legal counsel and official government agencies in hardcopy format.
