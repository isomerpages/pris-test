To maintain a healthy relationship, it is important to have good communication with your loved ones.  DIRECT allows inmates to connect with their families through e-letters and it a platform for communication apart from the regular visit. 
As inmates using Direct e-letters are able to view their incoming letters and greeting cards on their electronic tablets, they shall no longer receive their incoming letters and greeting cards in hardcopy format from Jan 2022. The hardcopy letters and greeting cards will be scanned and made available to inmates on their electronic tablets. 

Letters from legal counsel or other official government agencies will continue to be provided to all inmates in hardcopy format.

Inmates not using Direct e-letters shall continue to receive their incoming letters and greeting cards, and letters from legal counsel and official government agencies in hardcopy format.
