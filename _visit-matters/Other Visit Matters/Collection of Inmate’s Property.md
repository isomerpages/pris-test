There are two ways to submit a request to collect an inmate’s property – via an online request or a hardcopy Letter of Authorisation Form (LOA).

**Online Request**<br>
The Main Visit Card Holder or any authorised person, may submit an online request for the inmate’s consent to collect his/her personal property via [this form.](https://www.form.gov.sg/#!/5f48ab32e305b500111cbe3d)

The applicant will be required to upload an image of the Visit Card for verification. Once the request is approved, a Letter of Authorisation signed by the inmate will be sent to the applicant via email.

**Hardcopy LOA**<br>
The applicant may submit a hardcopy LOA in person to request for consent to collect the inmate’s property. The LOA form is available at Prison Link Centre, Changi (PLCC). 

Once the form has been submitted, a processing time of at least five days is required, before the applicant is contacted to collect the signed form at PLCC.

**Collection of Inmate Property**<br>
With the signed LOA, the applicant can then arrange with ST Logistics for a suitable timing to pick up the inmate's belongings at their warehouse in Clementi.
