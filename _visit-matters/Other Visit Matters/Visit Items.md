**Reading Materials**<br>
SPS provides reading materials and resources to all inmates. Upon request by inmates, visitors are also allowed to bring in three reading materials during each visit. For remand inmates, the three reading materials can be brought in on a weekly basis. All materials received will be screened.

**Food Items**<br>
Pre-approved snack packs can be purchased at any of the five  Prison Link Centres via NETS Payment. Visitors are allowed to purchase these snack packs for the following categories of inmates during each visit;
1. Remand inmates (allowed to receive one snack pack through visits weekly.)
2. Inmates undergoing the Drug Rehabilitation Regime
3. Inmates undergoing the Inhalant Abuse Regime

**Pre-Release Clothing**<br>
Visitors can hand over a set of clothing and footwear for inmates at least two weeks before their release date. 

The clothing can be handed over during any visit session at Prison Link Centre Changi, Prison Link Centre Tanah Merah or Prison Link Centre Selarang Park as early as two months before the release date.

**Other items**<br>
For other items such as spectacles, dentures, photographs and medications, the inmates are required to submit their request through the institutions. The requests are subject to approval, before the visitor is allowed to hand over the item during visit sessions.  

Unapproved items will not be accepted.

**Payment of Items purchased by inmates**<br>
For items available for inmates to purchase such as spectacles and dentures, they must submit a request first to the institution. The request has to be approved before the visitor is allowed to make payment via NETS or PayNow at our Prison Link Centres.
